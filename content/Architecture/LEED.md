The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a globally recognized green building certification system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). It provides a framework for architects, engineers, developers, and contractors to create healthy, highly efficient, and cost-saving green buildings. LEED certification is a symbol of sustainability achievement and leadership.

### Certification Levels
LEED certification is available for all building types and is divided into four levels based on a point system: Certified (40-49 points), Silver (50-59 points), Gold (60-79 points), and Platinum (80+ points). Points are awarded across several categories that address key aspects of sustainability:

1. **Sustainable Sites**: Encourages strategies that minimize the impact on ecosystems and water resources.
2. **Water Efficiency**: Promotes smart water use, both inside and outside the building.
3. **Energy and Atmosphere**: Focuses on optimizing energy performance, incorporating renewable energy, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
4. **Materials and Resources**: Encourages the use of sustainable building materials and reducing waste.
5. **Indoor Environmental Quality**: Aims to improve indoor air quality and provide access to natural daylight and views.
6. **Innovation in Design or Innovation in Operations**: Rewards innovative strategies that meet the intent of LEED but are not specifically addressed in the rating system.
7. **Regional Priority**: Addresses environmental priorities for specific regions.

### Process
The process of becoming LEED certified involves the completion of a green building design and construction according to LEED standards, followed by an application review by the Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). After a successful review, the project is awarded its LEED certification level.

### Benefits
LEED-certified buildings are designed to:
- **Lower operating costs and increase asset value.**
- **Reduce waste sent to landfills.**
- **Conserve energy and water.**
- **Be healthier and safer for occupants.**
- **Reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.**
- **Qualify for tax rebates, zoning allowances, and other incentives in many cities.**

Furthermore, LEED certification helps demonstrate an organization's commitment to environmental stewardship and social responsibility, enhancing its public image and potentially increasing business opportunities.

### Global Impact
As of my last update, LEED has grown to become the most widely used green building rating system in the world, with certifications in over 160 countries. It has transformed the way we think about how buildings and communities are designed, constructed, maintained, and operated. Through its comprehensive approach to sustainability, LEED continues to drive innovation and progress in the building industry, contributing significantly to global efforts to address climate change and promote environmental health.
