The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is a leading global environmental assessment method and rating system for buildings. Introduced in 1990 by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in the UK, BREEAM sets the standard for best practice in sustainable building design, construction, and operation. It is one of the oldest and most widely used methods to assess the environmental performance of buildings.

### Certification Levels
BREEAM evaluates buildings against a set of criteria covering a broad range of categories that reflect the various impacts buildings have on the environment. It awards certifications on a scale that includes Pass, Good, Very Good, Excellent, and Outstanding. The assessment process involves evaluating performance in areas such as:

1. **Energy**: Use of energy-efficient technologies and practices to reduce energy consumption.
2. **Land Use and Ecology**: Protection and enhancement of the natural environment around the development site.
3. **Water**: Strategies to reduce water consumption.
4. **Health and Wellbeing**: Ensuring good indoor environmental quality, including air quality, lighting, and acoustic performance.
5. **Pollution**: Reducing pollution from construction and operation of the building.
6. **Transport**: Encouraging sustainable transport options.
7. **Materials**: Use of environmentally preferable materials with lower life cycle impacts.
8. **Waste**: Strategies to reduce waste production and promote recycling during construction and operation.
9. **Management**: Management practices that promote sustainability from the design phase through to operation and maintenance of the building.

### Process
The process for achieving BREEAM certification involves the appointment of a BREEAM assessor who evaluates the project against the BREEAM criteria. The assessor collects evidence, performs site inspections, and ultimately awards a score that determines the project's certification level.

### Benefits
Buildings achieving BREEAM certification demonstrate a commitment to environmental excellence and sustainability, offering benefits such as:

- **Reduced operational costs** through energy and water efficiency.
- **Enhanced market value** and attractiveness to tenants and buyers.
- **Improved wellbeing** for occupants through better indoor environments.
- **Mitigation of environmental impact** by encouraging sustainable practices.
- **Regulatory compliance** with local and international standards for sustainable construction.

### Global Impact
BREEAM has been adapted for use in various countries, making it a flexible tool that can be localized to fit different climatic, cultural, and legal contexts. It has certified over 500,000 buildings worldwide and continues to influence the construction industry by setting high standards for sustainability and environmental performance. By providing a robust framework for improving the sustainability of buildings, BREEAM plays a crucial role in driving the global construction industry towards more sustainable development practices.
