## Key Features 

- **Expansive Knowledge Base**: This platform offers an extensive collection of resources on spatial design, architecture, and landscaping, curated to support both newcomers and professionals. It includes comprehensive articles, in-depth case studies, and practical tutorials designed to enhance your understanding and skills in various design disciplines.

- **Resource Library**: Gain access to an extensive selection of design tools, software tutorials, and a multimedia library filled with images, diagrams, and videos. These resources are carefully chosen to inspire your creativity and assist in the visualization and execution of your design projects.

- **Interactive Zettelkasten**: Adopting the Zettelkasten method, our platform allows for the creation, linkage, and exploration of notes in a non-linear manner. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interconnections within spatial design concepts, encouraging a more holistic and innovative thinking process.

- **Personalized Learning Pathways**: Tailor your educational journey through custom learning tracks that adapt to your interests and proficiency level. Whether you're starting from the basics or looking to specialize in a niche area of design, these pathways guide you through curated content, ensuring a structured and comprehensive learning experience. This feature supports the platform's goal of being an all-encompassing educational tool for designers, enabling users to not only access a wealth of information but also to navigate it in a way that aligns with their personal and professional growth objectives.

## The Goal

Create a space that stores all the information you need and everything you want online for starting your own project or for extended learning. Think of this as a Wikipedia for designers, with personal takeaways included.
