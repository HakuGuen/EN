Creating a detailed outline for "Sustainable and Green Architecture" involves discussing the foundational principles of sustainable design, followed by an examination of innovative sustainable projects and their impact. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of sustainable architecture.

### I. Introduction
- Definition of [Sustainable and Green Architecture](obsidian://open?vault=MyVault&file=content_en%2FArchitecture%2FSustainable%20vs%20Green)
- Importance of sustainability in the contemporary architectural landscape
- Overview of the structure of the outline

### II. Principles of Sustainable Design
#### A. Energy Efficiency
