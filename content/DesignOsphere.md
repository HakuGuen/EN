“Design-O-Sphere” could be used to describe the collective domain of design, encompassing all aspects, trends, practices, and communities within the field of design. This could include everything from graphic design, industrial design, user experience (UX) design, to architectural design, suggesting a global or holistic view of the design world and its influences.

Spatial design is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the flow of space and the interaction of people within these spaces. It encompasses various disciplines such as architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, interior design, and sometimes extends into fields like user experience (UX) design and virtual reality environments. The core objective of spatial design is to optimize the human experience in physical and sometimes virtual environments.
